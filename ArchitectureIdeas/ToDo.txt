* JumpTo References inside the Text? How to handle?
* Object handler, When will it be tested for "Clickable"?
* Exectuion of Events: Direct on start, on when something is clicked
 How about event which are needed to click on some thing like:
 "You enter a room find a Key and a locked door. Option: 1. Use the Key to open the door. 2. Turn around search for a second room."
 Another aspect to considere is the Save / load ability. One doesent wnat to have 2 keys in the inventory, right?
