# GenericPlaybook
Messing with the Idea to have a book as a game, transfering it to a computer environment
## Idea
Inspired on the Books by Jackson, Steve / Livingstone, Ian, like the "Duell der Piraten" I wantto trans fer it to a computer enwirionment. As far as I know this is not the first time it got transfered. Motliely it will not be the best port. With this projects I want train my development skills. The Project will be split into serveral parts:
* The Generic handling, this repositry
* Content of the actual Playbook (second private repositry)
* Non public third party librarys (third private repositry)
